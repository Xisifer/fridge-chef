Project description
Problem - don’t know what to eat for dinner but got some ingredients in the fridge? 
Solution - Fridge chef. Our website will offer the user to select certain ingredients that they have in their fridge. There will be a list with checkboxes containing many common ingredients, grouped into categories, such as;
Protein
Steak
Chicken breast
Vegetables
Lettuce
Tomato
Onion
Eggplant
Dairy
Milk
Butter
Cream
After the user has selected their ingredients and pressed the submit button, the website will search for recipes containing their ingredients. Related recipes will appear and alongside each one, there will be a related YouTube video. The user can then choose whether they’d prefer to read the recipe or watch one instead.
There will be an option to email the recipe to yourself for later viewing.
